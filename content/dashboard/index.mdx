**Different ways to construct your own network**

As you may notice, there are 2 important elements for a network -- nodes and edges, which corresponds to genes and gene-gene interactions in biological domain. Thus, you can construct your own network through 2 different ways -- **Search By Multiple Genes** and **Upload Network**.&#x20;

### **Search By Multiple Genes**

This method allows you to construct the network by providing the gene names or Ensembl IDs, which we call them **seed genes**. Then you can select different network options and create your own network using the gene-gene interaction data in our tool.

For more detailed explanation, please check our [Search By Multiple Genes](dashboard/search-by-multiple-genes.mdx) section.

### **Upload Network**

This method allows you to construct the network by providing your own network file (gene-gene interactions), which contains the interactions among all the genes in your network.&#x20;

For more detailed explanation, please check our [Upload Network](dashboard/upload-network.mdx) section.
