## Disclaimer

While building this project in Dockerized form or publishing the website in production, I encourage you to upload videos (as maintaining it in `git lfs` is going to cost it), please keep all the related videos in [this folder](/public/video/). All the videos are currently uploaded in this [gdrive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LvPTY8Z559shYoWTaSOHFuWOFKGG8QHv), you can download them from there and upload them in the above-mentioned folder.
