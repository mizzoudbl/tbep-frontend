This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm
# or
bun
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Disclaimer

Dependencies not to upgrade:

```
@radix-ui/react-scroll-area past v1.2.0
```

- Don't use the latest version of @radix-ui/react-scroll-area as it messes up with the scroll position in the left side bar. v1.2.0 is the latest version that works fine with the current codebase.
**Hours wasted:** 3hr

- While building this project in Dockerized form or publishing the website in production, I encourage you to upload videos (as maintaining it in `git lfs` is going to cost it), please keep all the related videos in [this folder](/public/video/). All the videos are currently uploaded in this [gdrive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LvPTY8Z559shYoWTaSOHFuWOFKGG8QHv), you can download them from there and upload them in the above-mentioned folder.
